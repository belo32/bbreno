<p>Wow!! Thank you for sharing! <br>I read most of your posts on Node as it's gold information : good structure, good design, good practices... Very sleek! Congrats!</p><p>I am quite struggling to merge your "easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local" along with your "todo-MEAN".</p><p>Indeed, they have complete different structure : <br>   On one hand "todo-MEAN" relies on a single front-end route like "app.get('*', index)" while "node-authentication" relies on several routes to handle login, signup and profile.</p><p>I could basically create a special route to serve the required "todo-MEAN" app, but I have a SPA structure in mind and my different routes are handled by Angular to be served asynchronously with a $routeProvider Controller. I thus have "PARTIALS" instead of "PAGES".</p><p>How do you handle PARTIALS authentication with passport? Is it possible?</p><p>Thanks in advance for your reply.</p>

<p>Hello. Thanks for reading first of all.</p><p>So I gather that you are trying to do authentication completely using an $http service from Angular to hit your Node authentication route. I've been working this out myself so I can write an article on it, but I believe that for authentication like that, you are going to have to redirect at some point for social connections (since you have to send a user to Facebook, Twitter, or Google to authenticate).</p><p>If you are authenticating locally, you could use $http to call a Node route. Then instead of doing a <code>successRedirect</code>, you could pass back json.</p><p></p><pre>app.get('/auth/local/callback', <br>     passport.authenticate('local', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),<br><br><br>     // function to specifically handle the callback and pass json back<br>     function(req, res) {<br>          res.json('success!');<br>     });<br></pre><p></p><p>Hopefully that helps. I can help clarify if that doesn't make complete sense.</p>

<p>Ok I get the idea.<br>I should then play with angular's $http calls instead of trying to make node handle the whole redirection.</p><p>But I still have some misunderstandings about partials : since I use only one route to serve front-end app, what is the best way to manage local variables?</p><p>For instance, when login with passport, your tutorial handles a pretty usefull "flash.message()" in case of login errors and "listens" to this underlying "message" to be displayed inside the template. This is working because it is not a Single Page App and thus every routes are explicitly handled one by one from the server-side.</p><p>But in my Single Page tryout I have a "no-refresh magic" happening with Angular at the front-end (exactly the same structure taken from your own tutorial here : <a href="http://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript/single-page-apps-with-angularjs-routing-and-templating)" rel="nofollow">http://scotch.io/tutorials/jav...</a>.<br>So when I go through all the process of calling the root "homepage" that initializes every local-variables like for instance "flash.message()" or "req.user" and decide to go to <br></p><pre>http://localhost:3000/TODO<br></pre><p><br> that WORKS LIKE A CHARM! ;-)</p><p>Unfortunately, when I try to directly reach the same<br></p><pre>http://localhost:3000/TODO<br></pre><p><br> from the address bar I get a very ugly error message telling me that "message" is undefined...</p><p>I clearly understand why it's undefined : flash.message() depends on my base/layout/index (I mean the non refreshed part of the page) while "/TODO" is only a partial totally unaware of local-variables initially sent by Node.js...<br>But... I am not good enough to resolve this problem by my own! :-)</p><p>I will then wait for your next Tutorial!!! ahah!!</p>

<p>You are completely correct that Node has not sent the variables to your partial/view. The way to resolve this is to think of your application differently. Since you are creating a single page app with Angular, you want to treat Node as an API/Data layer and Angular as the frontend.</p><p>This means that all your data will be passed from Node to Angular using $http calls. So those variables like messages and passing user data should be passed to Angular in your Angular controller.</p><p>For a little more information on that, check out our other article: <a href="http://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript/creating-a-single-page-todo-app-with-node-and-angular" rel="nofollow">http://scotch.io/tutorials/jav...</a> It will help to understand how to pass data to and from Node to Angular.</p><p>Hopefully that helps a bit more and I'll start thinking up new articles to be closer to your current scenario.</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p><p>Thanks for that, what I'm having trouble with is actually sending messages to Angular from the server. There is only a callback function for the passport.authenticate on success (it seems), if you try to sign up with the same email address for example, it just returns the failureRedirect html if I log it out to the console:</p><p>This is the route: <a href="http://cl.ly/ToOU" rel="nofollow">http://cl.ly/ToOU</a><br>This is the strategy: <a href="http://cl.ly/Tnzn" rel="nofollow">http://cl.ly/Tnzn</a><br>Angular service: <a href="http://cl.ly/Toj1" rel="nofollow">http://cl.ly/Toj1</a></p><p>I know I am missing something and your guidance would be hugely appreciated, I have looked everywhere and can't find the answer. I'm fairly new to all this.</p><p>Cheers!</p>

<p>You could try not using failureRedirect at all and handling everything in a custom callback. In your custom callback, you could check for a success variable and handle both failure and success within that. Hopefully that helps.</p><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15388206/sending-back-a-json-response-when-failing-passport-js-authentication" rel="nofollow">http://stackoverflow.com/quest...</a><br><a href="http://passportjs.org/guide/authenticate/" rel="nofollow">http://passportjs.org/guide/au...</a> (the custom callback section)</p>

<p>Hey Chris great tutorial, came across it after trawling the web and can honestly say that scotch has by far the best and most importantly, up-to-date guides than anywhere else which is crucial in a field which advances as fast as this one. Question, at the bottom of the tutorial for your edits it says you implemented the async methods for the password hashing but I see the sync methods there, am I looking at the wrong thing? Once again thanks for everything and keep up the good work.</p>

<p>Hey Chris, your article is golden, but I have 2 questions!</p><p>1)  Do you plan to write an article about <a href="http://socket.io/" rel="nofollow">socket.io</a> and combine ALL those authentication methods with websockets?</p><p>2) If not I need to know what your suggestion is to me about the following:<br> is it better to keep using sessions like you did above - or should I use tokens with websockets, like this article suggests (<a href="https://auth0.com/blog/2014/01/07/angularjs-authentication-with-cookies-vs-token/)" rel="nofollow">https://auth0.com/blog/2014/01...</a> ?</p><p>p.s1: I plan to use websockets with a mobile app - !<br>p.s2: I'm totally new to node.js<br>Thank you</p>

<p>1. <a href="http://socket.io/" rel="nofollow">socket.io</a> articles are in the pipeline. <a href="http://socket.io/" rel="nofollow">socket.io</a> and this much authentication is probably a while away. still have to get through some basic <a href="http://socket.io/" rel="nofollow">socket.io</a> articles and then authentication articles like node and tokens, mean stack authentication.</p><p>2. That's a good resource. I think tokens are definitely the way to go. All the great companies that go that route can't be wrong!</p><p>Keep going with Node and good luck with your mobile app. You're on the right track.</p>

<p>Hey, great tutorial...</p><p>Im annoyingly falling at the last hurdle, I can login, signup but my user isnt being passed to my profile page so i get this error:</p><p>&gt;&gt; 21|                 &lt;% if (<a href="http://account.email/" rel="nofollow">account.email</a>) { %&gt;</p><p>    22|                     </p><p></p><p>    23| 						</p><p>&lt;%= account.account_type %&gt;</p><p></p><p>    24| 						</p><p>&lt;%= account.username %&gt;</p><p></p><p>Cannot read property 'email' of undefined</p><p>(using 'account' instead of user)</p><p>both my login and signup's return the account in the done function and my route.js looks the same. A quick google told me i needed to stringify but thats not helped:</p><p>app.get('/profile', isLoggedIn, function(req, res) {<br>        var jaccount = JSON.stringify(req.account);<br>        res.render('../app/views/profile/index.ejs', {<br>            account : jaccount<br>        });<br>    });</p><p>please help!</p><p>Ashley</p>

<p>Works great! I was wondering what's the best way to send a status back to the server to notify if success or error? such as res.sendStatus(401). This could be useful when implementing login and registration on a single page app where you have an interceptor to receive the status and react. Should it be from within the strategy or from the post request? An example extending your current code would be great. Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Chris, just another feedback:</p><p>I see that on your tutorials you're not consistent when requiring your own modules,</p><p>sometimes it's:require('./config/database.js');</p><p>and sometimes it's without '.js' like this: require('./config/database');</p><p>personally i like the non-extension style because it feels more like a module than a file, but whatever approach you choose, I recommend stay with one to prevent audience confusion (:</p>

<p>I read a bit of passport source code. Correct me if I'm wrong.</p><p>The usage of the term serialization is confusing to me here. If you truly serialize everything on the user into a string and store it in the session, and deserialize it without hitting the DB then you would in fact be correct. However, with the example implementation in the tutorial, you only store (or serialize) the userID into the session, and then you bring the user object back you need to hit the DB to search for the entire user with User.findById.</p><p>So to answer dmitry's question, this implementation does hit the database every single time an already authenticated request comes in. However, you could easily avoid that by serializing the entire user object into the session and deserialize it back, provided that everything can fit into the session object. If you use cookieSession, I believe cookie has some inherent limit in size. If you use session, then it's an in-memory store then it's fine. However, many would store  session in some sort of DB anyway.</p>

<p>Sorry for the stupid question, but I don't understand the comment:</p><p>        // User.findOne wont fire unless data is sent back</p><p>Is this talking about whether the  "User.findOne..." line is executed at all, or about what happens after the find is performed?</p><p>By the way, I posted a couple of issues on Github (though the most important one relates to code not in this first part of the tutorial). </p>

<p>Sorry instead of "won't fire unless", that should be "won't fire until" so the callback will queue up the job and wait until information is sent back from the authentication to run User.findOne. It won't be able to findOne if there is no data to check. This is how we make this call asynchronous and non-blocking.</p><p>I saw the issues on Github. Won't be able to get to them this week, but I'll try for early next week. If you figure it out, send a pull request too!</p>

<p>I'm still a little confused by this. The strategy's callback function would always have the information (in this case email &amp; password) when it is called, right? It is just middleware so I don't see how it would be called without it. The only reason for the `process.nextTick` is if the database function to find the user was blocking. With mongoose this is not the case though so I don't think it would be necessary in this project.  Am I on the right track here?</p>

<p>Hi Chris.  I don't know if you still see these comments, but i'm having an issue with this section of the code.  Basically when I submit the signup form, the web page just times out.  Now i'm traced it as best I can with log statements, and it is getting to the User.findOne() Call, but the completion closure is never getting executed.  So I don't know if findOne is not getting run, or if it is just never finishing.</p>

<p>OK, thanks for the clarification.</p><p>I'm kind of new to Github, Node and JS so I'll take a look but not sure I can determine the best solution.</p><p>The signup problem seems to be from line 108-115 of passport.js. I think it might be solved by replacing the whole block with the following line, but could be misunderstanding something:</p><p>return done(null, req.user);</p><p>For the email addresses I'd just convert to lower-case before saving or comparing to the database, and after loading from the database to support existing databases with mixed-case email addresses. </p>

<p>One problem with my proposed solution: Since the database is being searched by e-mails obviously it's not possible to just convert the one DB e-mail address to lower-case before comparing. This means that in order to support existing databases with mixed-case e-mail addresses, it would be necessary to either:<br>a. Run slower, mixed-case searches for e-mail addresses using regular expressions<br>or <br>b. Convert all database e-mail addresses to lower-case using a one-time script.</p><p>For new projects without users in an existing database there would be no problem, though.</p>

<p>P.S. - The advantage to using a regexp search is that it could be used for intentionally-mixed-case usernames if somebody preferred to use those in place of e-mail addresses.</p><p>I could try creating a pull request for my current code, which converts all e-mail addresses to lower-case (including Facebook and Google addresses), but I don't know whether that's your preferred solution.</p>

<p>I've created a pull request for the signup issue. I had previously misunderstood the purpose of the existing code (to connect a local account) -- my proposed solution retains that functionality while preventing existing local account info from being overwritten. As mentioned, though, I'm new to this, so please verify the changes before applying.</p>

<p>Hey. Great additions and great thought process. I've merged the request to the repo. Thanks very much for helping this project get better. I agree that changing the database to be all lowercase after the fact is a hard thing to do. You should definitely start the database the lowercase way.</p><p>I believe case shouldn't make two different usernames or two different emails so making them lowercase is a good idea. Thanks again.</p>
